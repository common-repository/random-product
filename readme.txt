Displays a random product from the WP e-Commerce plugin in a widget.

== Description ==

This widget will select a random product from the WP e-Commerce (part of WP-Shopping-cart) list of products and display in a given sidebar. This plugin will
only work with the WP e-Commerce plugin. It requires that permalinks be enabled so that the link from the widget will work properly.

== Changelog ==

= 1.2 =
Fixed a line of debug code left over.

= 1.1 =
* Fixed a bug that made it possible to select a product that had been deleted.

== Installation ==

After downloading:

1. Upload the `random-product` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Set the products page permalink - <u>without the slashes</u>. The default permalink is 'products-page', as is with the plugin. No editing should be needed unless the deafault permalink is changed.
4. Set the widget title according to how you want it to display in the sidebar.
